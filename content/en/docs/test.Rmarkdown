## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## Math 

$\sum(a+b)$

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Violin Plot with `ggplot2`

```{r}
# Library
library(ggplot2)

# create a dataset
data <- data.frame(
  name=c( rep("A",500), rep("B",500), rep("B",500), rep("C",20), rep('D', 100)  ),
  value=c( rnorm(500, 10, 5), rnorm(500, 13, 1), rnorm(500, 18, 1), rnorm(20, 25, 4), rnorm(100, 12, 1) )
)

# Most basic violin chart
ggplot(data, aes(x=name, y=value, fill=name)) + # fill=name allow to automatically dedicate a color for each group
  geom_violin()
```

## Violin Plot with 

```{r}
library(plotly)

df <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/violin_data.csv")

fig <- df %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~day, y = ~total_bill, split = ~day, type = "violin",
    box = list(visible = T),
    meanline = list(visible = T))

fig <- fig %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Day"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Total Bill", zeroline = F)
  )

fig
```
