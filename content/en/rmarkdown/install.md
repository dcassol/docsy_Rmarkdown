## Prerequisites and Installation

### Install {blogdown} and Hugo

#### blogdown

```r
installed.packages("rstudio/blogdown")
# If anything wrong try develop version
remotes::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
```
#### Hugo

You need a recent extended version (we recommend version 0.79.0 or later) of Hugo 
to do local builds and previews of sites that use Docsy.

It is recommended to install `Hugo` from R for working with {blogdown}

```r
blogdown::install_hugo(extended = TRUE)
```
or from commandline

```bash
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.79.0/hugo_extended_0.79.0_Linux-64bit.deb
sudo dpkg -i  hugo_extended_0.79.0_Linux-64bit.deb 
hugo version
```

For `Windows` and `macOS` please see instructions [here](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/). 

#### Install PostCSS

[Download `node` and `npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you do not have.

To build or update your site's CSS resources, you also need `PostCSS` to create the final assets. If you need to install it, you must have a recent version of `NodeJS` installed on your machine so you can use `npm`, the Node package manager. By default `npm` installs tools under the directory where you run `npm` install:

```bash
sudo npm install -D autoprefixer
sudo npm install -D postcss-cli
# Starting in version 8 of postcss-cli, you must also separately install postcss:

sudo npm install -D postcss

# go to your website directory
cd <repository_name>
npm audit fix
```

### Run the website locally 

#### with {blogdown} (**Recommended**)

* Open R in console or Rstudio 

This repo contains a `.Rprofile` file that will automatically serve the site
for you R starting directory is this newly cloned repository. Otherwise, 
change working directory to the repository and run:

```r
blogdown::serve_site()
```

You should see a website is opened in your local browser or Rstudio viewer.

#### Run the website locally in the terminal

```bash
cd YOUR_NEW_REPO_PATH
hugo serve -b "http://localhost" 
```
