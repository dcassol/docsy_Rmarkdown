## Prerequisites and Installation

### Install [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)

You need a recent extended version (we recommend version 0.79.0 or later) of Hugo 
to do local builds and previews of sites that use Docsy.

```
wget https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.79.0/hugo_extended_0.79.0_Linux-64bit.deb
sudo dpkg -i  hugo_extended_0.79.0_Linux-64bit.deb 
hugo version
```

For `Windows` and `macOS` please see instructions [here](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/). 

### Install PostCSS

To build or update your siteâ€™s CSS resources, you also need PostCSS to create the final assets. If you need to install it, you must have a recent version of NodeJS installed on your machine so you can use npm, the Node package manager. By default npm installs tools under the directory where you run npm install:

sudo npm install -D autoprefixer
sudo npm install -D postcss-cli
Starting in version 8 of postcss-cli, you must also separately install postcss:

sudo npm install -D postcss

# Documentation

This Docsy Template Project uses the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme, as well as providing a skeleton documentation structure for you to use. The full documentation can be found [here](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/deployment/).

## Create new content

> **_Important:_** All the RMarkdown files should have `.Rmarkdown` extension, e.g. `tutorial.Rmakdown`


<details>
<summary><b>
ToDo
</b></summary

* Add documentation for the custom configuration.

# Deploy

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Create a new branch named `gh-pages`

```
git checkout -b gh-pages
rm -rv !(.git|README.md)
git add . && git commit -m "gh-pages" && git push
git checkout main
git add . && git commit -m "pg_build" && git push
```
* To trigger a build and deployment event, in the `git commit` message, include the word "**pg_build**", e.g. `git commit -m "pg_build"`. This will run the full rendering process (rendering and deploy the website may still take a few minutes).

### Setting 

* Click on **Setting**
* click on **GitHub Pages** 
* Select Branch *gh-pages* and folder */(root)* and click on **Save**
* Click on **Enforce HTTPS** 

### Details

* The first deployment can take some time
* If you have build the site locally and updated the `/public` locally, in the `commit` message, 
include the word "**no_render**". This will skip the site rendering process and
jump to page deployment directly which takes less than 30s to update website.
